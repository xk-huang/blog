## Hello, welcome to my blog!

- I'm Xiaoke Huang, an undergraduate from BNU CS. Here are my [personal page](https://xk-huang.github.io/) and  [résumé (old)](/uploads/resume.pdf)
- I'm exploring ~~Face Recognition & Model Quantization~~ **Neural Rendering & Ordinal Regression**  right now.
- I like participating in programming contests! (Though I'm far from being an expert)
- Feel free to drop me an e-mail (xiaokehuang [at] foxmail [dot] com)
- I'm a chocoholic. Bean-to-bar chocolate is my favourite
